# Matrix_structural_analysis
 Structural analysis using matrices

This program uses the matrix method of structural analysis using stiffnesses to calculate the deflections and the reactions at the joints/nodes.

REUIRMENTS:
 1. Python 3
 2. Command prompt or a Python interpreter

HOW TO USE IT:
 1. Open the following files and add your data then click save: stiffness.txt, joint load.txt, force matric.txt, member reaction.txt. These files are the input files where you enter your data. Each file has its own header section where it details how to use it, please avoid deleting this header section for future reference.
 2. Open your IDE and open the project (navigate to where you extracted the downloaded zip file).
 3. Run the main.py file.
 4. the results will be printed in the Output.txt file.
 
 WARNING!
 1. DO NOT use this for serious structural analysis work. this is just a simple program meant for demonstration purposes. The author shall not be held liable for any wrongful use of this program.
 2. DO NOt delete the files as doing so is a permanent action that cannot be undone. Instead, it is advisable to make a backup of the original download files incase you delete something.
